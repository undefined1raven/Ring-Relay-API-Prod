##### Note: this isn't the repo for the app mentioned on my linkedin or resume, this is a complete remake of the Ring Relay I've built a year ago

## About

A chatting app that lets you see different stats about your texts and conversations such as freqency maps for words, average length of each message and more. I'd love for this app to use a dynamic unique design. I'll also implement end-to-end encryption using a public-private key pair for each user. I'll detail the architecture implemented later on.
